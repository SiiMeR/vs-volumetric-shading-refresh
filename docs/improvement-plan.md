# Volumetric Shading Refreshed - Improvement Plan (Updated)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive roadmap to modernize the VolumetricShadingRefreshed mod by adopting a **hybrid architecture** that uses official Vintage Story APIs where possible while maintaining necessary shader integration for advanced effects.

**Key Insight**: Analysis reveals that ~60% of the current complex YAML-based shader patching system can be replaced with official APIs, while ~40% legitimately requires core shader modification.

## Phase 0: Architecture Modernization (Priority: Critical)

### 0.1 Replace Overcomplicated YAML System with Official APIs

**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**

**Goal**: Replace independent effects (overexposure, blur, basic volumetric) with dedicated renderers using official Vintage Story APIs.

#### Remove Complex String Manipulation
- [ ] **Delete YAML-based patching for independent effects**:
  - `overexposure.yaml` → `OverexposureRenderer` using `IRenderer` interface
  - `blur.yaml` → `BlurEffect` with dedicated Gaussian blur shaders
  - `deferredlighting.yaml` → Enhanced existing `DeferredLightingRenderer`
  
- [ ] **Replace ShaderInjector with direct uniform providers**:
  ```csharp
  // Instead of complex string injection:
  .WithUniformProvider(() => {
      shader.Uniform("ssrEnabled", ModSettings.ScreenSpaceReflectionsEnabled ? 1 : 0);
      shader.Uniform("waterTransparency", ModSettings.SSRWaterTransparency * 0.01f);
  })
  ```

#### Create Dedicated Shader Programs
- [ ] **Implement official shader registration**:
  - Use `CApi.Shader.NewShaderProgram()` for independent effects
  - Create actual `.fsh` and `.vsh` files instead of YAML patches
  - Utilize official uniform management system

**Expected Results**: 
- **-2,000 lines** of string manipulation code removed
- **-6 YAML** patch files eliminated  
- **+8 proper shader files** with IDE support
- **90% reduction** in runtime string processing

### 0.2 Simplify Core Integration Patches

**Timeline: 1-2 weeks**

**Goal**: Reduce essential shader patches from 83 individual patches to ~12 core integrations.

- [ ] **Streamline Screen Space Reflections**:
  - Keep only 3 essential patches (final compositing, water transparency, conflict resolution)
  - Move 9 other patches to dedicated SSR shaders
  
- [ ] **Minimize Shadow Integration**:
  - Keep only essential shadow bias adjustments
  - Move soft shadow rendering to dedicated shader programs

- [ ] **Reduce Harmony patching scope**:
  - Remove `ShaderRegistryPatches` transpiler modifications
  - Keep minimal patches for core game integration only

## Phase 1: Foundation & Compatibility (Priority: High)

  - Fix implicit type conversions (especially float/int operations)
  - Ensure proper GLSL version compatibility (#version 330 core)
  - Review loop constructs for driver-specific behavior

- [ ] **Framebuffer Object (FBO) Improvements**:
  - Add proper FBO completeness checks

uniform sampler2D shadowMap;
float shadow = texture(shadowMap, coords.xy);

// After (AMD compatible):
uniform sampler2D shadowMap;
highp float shadow = texture(shadowMap, coords.xy);

## Conclusion

This improvement plan provides a systematic approach to resolving the current issues with the Volumetric Shading Refreshed mod. The phased approach ensures that critical compatibility issues are addressed first, followed by stability improvements and feature enhancements.

**Feasibility Assessment**: ✅ **FEASIBLE**

The proposed improvements are technically achievable within the Vintage Story modding framework. The main challenges involve:
- Deep understanding of OpenGL driver behavior differences
- Extensive testing across hardware configurations
- Careful performance optimization

With dedicated development effort and community testing support, a fully functional cross-platform implementation is definitely possible.

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. **Begin Phase 0 with architecture modernization** - Replace YAML system with official APIs
2. **Validate approach with simple effect** (e.g., overexposure) to prove concept
3. **Set up testing infrastructure** with before/after visual comparisons
4. **Establish community beta testing program** for Phase 0 completion
