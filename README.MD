# Volumetric Shading Refreshed

A continuation of a shader mod for Vintage Story

## How it works

The mod works by defining snippets of shader code (found in the [assets folder](https://github.com/SiiMeR/vs-volumetric-shading-refresh/tree/master/VolumetricShadingRefreshed/VolumetricShadingRefreshed/assets/volumetricshadingrefreshed)). These shader snippets are then dynamically inserted based on a matching regex.
